Here is an implementation of deep Q-learning agent on the CartPole-v0 task. It is my first RL model. 

Initially, I followed the pytorch [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html) and then I found some areas to improve the code which I did.  

This [RL course](https://simoninithomas.github.io/Deep_reinforcement_learning_Course/) by Thomas Simonini has helped me a lot. It has very nice simple examples written in Tensorflow that you can look at.

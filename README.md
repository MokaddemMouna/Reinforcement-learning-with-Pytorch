# Reinforcement-learning-with-Pytorch

Although I read about reinforcement learning before and some of its applications in different domains. I have never taken an academic course and experimented models formerly. In the actual covid-19 crisis, I decided to dedicate time on a regular basis to study formerly the topic by going through a series of materials and models.

I started by taking reinforcement learning [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&list=PLqYmG7hTraZBiG_XpjnPrSNw-1XQaM_gB) of **David Silver** on Youtube. And here I try to experiment some reinforcement learning models, mixed with deep learning, to improve my understanding of the learned abstract concepts and see how we can apply those concepts to solve real-world problems. 

Please feel free to reach out to me to discuss any model of this topic as well as nlp models implemented in my [other repository](https://github.com/MokaddemMouna/Pytorch).

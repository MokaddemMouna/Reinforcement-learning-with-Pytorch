# Reinforcement-learning-with-Pytorch

I am taking reinforcement learning [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&list=PLqYmG7hTraZBiG_XpjnPrSNw-1XQaM_gB) of **David Silver** on Youtube. And here I try to experiment some reinforcement learning models, mixed with deep learning, to improve my understanding of the learned abstract concepts and see how we can apply those concepts to solve real-world problems.
